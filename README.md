# Daily-Birth-Statistics-Mapped-to-Zodiac-Signs
Independent research on daily birth distributions: comparing calendar aggregation vs. solar-ecliptic (360°) aggregation using ephemerides.
Project: Birth Distribution: Calendar vs. Solar-Ecliptic Aggregation

Goal: Compare daily births aggregation in (a) calendar time and (b) solar-ecliptic (360°) time using ephemerides-based solar longitude mapping.

Key idea: The same daily birth series can be regrouped by equal solar-longitude segments (e.g., 12×30°) instead of calendar months. This repository documents the pipeline and provides reproducible analysis.

Disclaimer: This is a statistical/methodological observation and does not claim causal mechanisms.
## Data availability

Raw and processed daily birth datasets are hosted on Kaggle due to size and licensing constraints.
